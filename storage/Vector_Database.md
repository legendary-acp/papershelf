## 1. Introduction
This paper attempts to consolidate all the information regarding vector databases including algorithms for solving ANN and NNN problem using hash-based, tree-based & graph-based approaches. 
It also mentioned what challenges are faced while developing vector databases.
It also touched upon use cases of combining Large Language Models with Vector Database and vice versa, how they can help each other in generating value.
At last it introduced Retrieval-Based LLM which is enhancement of LLMs and hot topic of research.
